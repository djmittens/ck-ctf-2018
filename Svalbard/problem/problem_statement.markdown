## CryptoKnight

kript≈ç, A modern tech company decides to make business by coming up with a way to find the quicket and cheapest mode of cab ride that can be paid with crypto currency. They now want to build an internal tool to store their users passwords. Their software engineer, Dave, has developed a specification for a file format which you can find it [here](spec.markdown).

Their database that has the master key to the crypto vallet account for all Uber (using it as an example, nothing against them) rides can be found as [extreme_secret.db](extreme_secret.db) with password "uberpass" (ü§¶). 

Find the Master password by decrypting the file.

You can either write a script by understanding the spec or do it by hand. The DB isn't all that big!
