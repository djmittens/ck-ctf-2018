# Credit Karma Capture the Flag 2018

This is my very first participation in something like this. It was very challengine, but in the end i have learned and gotten way farther than i would have ever expected.

In this repository you will find my writeups (as complete as i could make them), about some of the more interesting challenges.  I am not the best note keeper out there, however i tried to document the challenges that i had trouble with or needed to put in more work and research into.


That being said , i found FB-CTF platform not very performant in my browser, so i started writing some scripts to automate some of my interactions that you can find in [HERE](ctf-website/).

Also as another aside, i learned how to program in python during this competition as well, so in order to make sure my code was portable i used `pyenv`, so if you see any `Pipfile`'s around, thats the ticket to getting the scripts to run.
